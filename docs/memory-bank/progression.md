# Vibing Crystal Defender - Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Development Environment Setup 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Created basic project structure with index.html, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Included Three.js via CDN
- Set up a basic HTML container for the game
- Added initial styling
- Created a test to verify Three.js loading

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 2: Rendering the Basic Map
- Implement a 3D scene with Three.js
- Add a plane as the floor
- Position camera in first-person perspective

**Notes:**
- The environment is set up to be lightweight and compatible with shared hosting
- No Node.js/NPM dependencies are required, as specified in the implementation plan
- All testing can be done using a simple local server or by opening the HTML file directly

## Step 2: Basic Map Rendering 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Set up a Three.js scene with sky background
- Created a perspective camera positioned at the center of the arena (x=0, y=1.6, z=0)
- Added a 100x100 plane as the floor positioned at y=0
- Implemented a basic rendering loop (animate function)
- Added window resize handling for responsive display
- Organized code using OOP approach within the VibingCrystalDefender class

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 3: Player Movement
- Implement WASD controls for camera movement
- Add mouse controls for camera rotation
- Set arena boundaries

**Notes:**
- The scene is very basic with just a green floor and blue sky
- Camera is positioned at eye-level (y=1.6) looking forward
- The rendering loop is working correctly and the scene is visible

## Step 3: Player Movement 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Added PointerLockControls for mouse-based camera rotation
- Implemented WASD and arrow key controls for player movement
- Added arena boundaries (-50 to 50 on x and z axes)
- Created player velocity and movement system
- Added crosshair cursor for aiming
- Set up event listeners for keyboard and mouse interaction

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 3.1: Mobile Controls
- Implement touch joystick controls for movement on mobile devices
- Add mobile device detection
- Create touch-friendly interface elements

**Notes:**
- Movement is locked to the XZ plane (no jumping/flying)
- Clicking the game window locks the mouse pointer for camera control
- Player cannot move outside the defined arena boundaries
- Movement is handled in the updatePlayerMovement function during the animation loop

## Step 3.1: Mobile Controls 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Added Nipple.js library for virtual joysticks
- Implemented mobile device detection
- Created left joystick interface for movement
- Implemented direct touch control for camera rotation
- Made controls responsive for different screen orientations
- Updated movement system to work with both keyboard and joystick input
- Added debug tools for mobile controls testing
- Implemented automatic and manual control switching based on screen size
- Simplified camera rotation using direct touch input instead of second joystick

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 4: Character Selection
- Create a menu HTML for class selection
- Implement class-specific properties
- Add a start button to begin gameplay

**Notes:**
- Mobile controls automatically activate when the game detects a mobile device or touch screen
- Left joystick controls player movement relative to current camera orientation
- Direct touch on screen controls camera rotation (looking around)
- Mobile UI is designed to be usable in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Movement boundaries are the same as desktop controls (-50 to 50 on x and z axes)
- Added debug panel to monitor joystick values and toggle between mobile/desktop modes
- Controls now automatically switch based on screen resize for better testing
- Simplified camera rotation using Euler angles instead of quaternions for better performance

## Step 4: Character Selection 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Created a character selection menu with options for three classes:
  - Warrior (Guerreiro): High melee damage, more resistance
  - Archer (Arqueiro): Fast ranged attacks, high mobility
  - Mage (Mago): Powerful area magic attacks
- Implemented character selection functionality with visual feedback
- Added a start button that enables after character selection
- Integrated character selection with game initialization
- Player class is stored and will affect gameplay mechanics

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 5: Crystal Implementation
- Create the central crystal that needs to be defended
- Implement crystal health system
- Add visual feedback for crystal status

**Notes:**
- Character selection happens before the 3D scene is rendered
- Selected character is stored in the game class and will influence game mechanics
- The menu is hidden once the game starts
- UI elements are styled to match the game's aesthetic

## Step 4.1: Translation System 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Created a translations.json file with support for Portuguese (pt-br) and English (en)
- Implemented a LanguageManager class to handle translations
- Added a language selector in the UI with PT/EN options
- Updated all UI elements to use translation keys
- Made the system extensible for future language additions
- Implemented automatic translation of UI when language is changed
- Added character class name translation between languages

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 5: Crystal Implementation
- Continue with the main gameplay features

**Notes:**
- Default language is set to Portuguese (pt-br)
- Translations are organized in a structured JSON format by categories (menu, UI, gameplay)
- UI elements use data-i18n attributes to reference translation keys
- Language selection is persisted during gameplay
- System includes mapping for character class names between languages
- All user-facing text now comes from the translation system for easier localization
