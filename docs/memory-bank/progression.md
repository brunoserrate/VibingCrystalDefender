# Vibing Crystal Defender - Implementation Progress

## Step 1: Development Environment Setup ✅

**Completed Tasks:**
- Created basic project structure with index.html, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Included Three.js via CDN
- Set up a basic HTML container for the game
- Added initial styling
- Created a test to verify Three.js loading

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 2: Rendering the Basic Map
- Implement a 3D scene with Three.js
- Add a plane as the floor
- Position camera in first-person perspective

**Notes:**
- The environment is set up to be lightweight and compatible with shared hosting
- No Node.js/NPM dependencies are required, as specified in the implementation plan
- All testing can be done using a simple local server or by opening the HTML file directly

## Step 2: Basic Map Rendering ✅

**Completed Tasks:**
- Set up a Three.js scene with sky background
- Created a perspective camera positioned at the center of the arena (x=0, y=1.6, z=0)
- Added a 100x100 plane as the floor positioned at y=0
- Implemented a basic rendering loop (animate function)
- Added window resize handling for responsive display
- Organized code using OOP approach within the VibingCrystalDefender class

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 3: Player Movement
- Implement WASD controls for camera movement
- Add mouse controls for camera rotation
- Set arena boundaries

**Notes:**
- The scene is very basic with just a green floor and blue sky
- Camera is positioned at eye-level (y=1.6) looking forward
- The rendering loop is working correctly and the scene is visible
