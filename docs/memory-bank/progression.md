- Position camera in first-person perspective

**Notes:**
- The environment is set up to be lightweight and compatible with shared hosting
- No Node.js/NPM dependencies are required, as specified in the implementation plan
- All testing can be done using a simple local server or by opening the HTML file directly

## Step 2: Basic Map Rendering 

**Completed Tasks:**
- Set up a Three.js scene with sky background
- Created a perspective camera positioned at the center of the arena (x=0, y=1.6, z=0)
- Added a 100x100 plane as the floor positioned at y=0

- Added window resize handling for responsive display
- Organized code using OOP approach within the VibingCrystalDefender class

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to Step 3: Player Movement
- Implement WASD controls for camera movement
- Add mouse controls for camera rotation
- Set arena boundaries

**Notes:**

- The crystal provides visual feedback by briefly turning red when damaged
- Health UI updates in real-time to show the current crystal status
- Enemies switch state from "moving" to "attacking" when reaching the crystal
- Game over screen offers a restart button to reload the game
